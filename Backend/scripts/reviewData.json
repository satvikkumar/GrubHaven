When asked they said they close by 11. My question is if they close by 11, why do they take our order in the first place? They could have asked us to have a take away.! Horrible ambience. Very bad staff and hopeless food. Burrito and tacos filling was very less. It was just like eating a plain maida chappati. We had to pack the remaining food as we were asked to vacate at 11.05 pm.

Located on 100 ft road, it can be easily spotted. Parking your vehicle might be a problem here.\n\nThe ambience was one of the most creative ones I've ever seen. Wonderfully decorated walls with some great graffiti work, various signboards of Bangalore and dark theme restaurant. The lights are dim and yellow and completely sync with the decor. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available. Though I prefer the indoors more. It also hosts live screening of sports.\n\nThe food here tastes really good. The best things to try here would be the Mexican paneer tacos, 7-layer burritos, Tikka burrito, Mexican fries and their nachos. If you want to taste authentic Mexican food, then this is the place for you. All the items were really spicy. The French fries were really good. They were tangy. Their sauces are really underrated. Must try them with your food. They still do have unlimited refill on Pepsi. Though I always feel that their Pepsi is diluted. The price for a taco, burrito, french fries and unlimited Pepsi was just 240 (veg one), which was very affordable according to me and stomach filling.\n\nThe staff people were helpful and enquired about the kind of taste you would like to have, so that they can give you the best.\n\nA really great place with unique interiors and amazing spicy food.

The food was delicious. The pastries to die for. Few things however need to be addressed:\n1) service. I see other users have said the wait staff are rude. That's not the impression I got. I think there are too few of them and they are stressed with having too much to do. Lavonne really needs more staff. The guy who took our order was also whipping up the drinks and handling the till. There's too much chaos in floor management. Which is a pity because the product is good and is being let down by poor organization.\n\n2) we sat in the outdoor seating but soon enough rushed indoors because other tables were smoking up a storm. I guess it's management's prerogative how they want to handle the smoking zone in their establishments, but this was really awful. If you're a non smoker and find cigarette smoke gross, sit inside. Also, it would be great if management labelled the area outside as a smoking zone, then customers would know to steer clear. It's one thing to sit in an outdoor terrace at a pub and smoke, but at breakfast, really?\n\n3) Don't keep people waiting for their orders, especially when there are children at the table. I felt really sorry for the family behind us who had to wait for a long time with hungry but well behaved kids. The mother had to finally go make a fuss at the counter before their order was sent to their table.\n\nBut the food, especially the baked goods are awesome.

So it had left over food from whoever was sitting before me and the guy who was serving me decided to serve me without even clearing and cleaning the table. When I asked him that he should have cleared the table first he just gave me a look and went off. Another time when it was too crowded and I was occupying one table one of the manager looking guys made it so awkward for me that I had to leave the table as soon as I was done eating. He kept coming out to the open smoking area and would just stand there and observe to make it awkward. So so disappointed. As I said it was a place I could just go and sit and have a cup of tea or work or just chill. Sadly not anymore. It's been more than 6 months that I visited the place and don't think I will go back to such attitude. I hope you guys at Lavonne are listening. Although it wouldn't matter to them if they lose one customer as it's always packed with people.", "reviewTimeFriendly": "20 days ago", "userName": "Nakul Sarin", "reviewTime": "2018-10-21 22:00:08", "ratingColor": "FF7800", "timestamp": 1540139408, "rating": 2}}, {"review": {"id": 39680031, "rating_5": 4, "reviewText": "Great place to try out some savoury desserts , their cakes are delicious but missed out on trying the famous cake-sickle \nWould definitely be back to try that out ", "reviewTimeFriendly": "22 days ago", "userName": "Prafful Siddanati", "reviewTime": "2018-10-19 14:30:19", "ratingColor": "5BA829", "timestamp": 1539939619, "rating": 4}}, {"review": {"id": 39651179, "rating_5": 4, "reviewText": "Ambience 8/10\nFood 9/10\nService 9/10\nPrice 7/10\n\nBeing a pastry school and teaching people how to bake, this bakery does amazing baked good.\nThier restaurant is very modern and they have a wide variety of treats on display.

Achieving balance? I'd like to think so. Ok, full disclosure : I went to Lavonne Cafe, Indranagar, Bangalore, just to try their desserts. Desserts, for me, have to have chocolate. Nothing else makes the cut. From left to right : 'Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Tart' was my favourite, with chocolate mousse on top, an almond sponge as the core and caramelised hazelnuts with bitter caramel in between. The middle one's a classic 'Tiramisu' but there wasn't anything &quot;classic&quot; about it. They've turned it into their own rendition of a coffee genoise with a fluffy mascarpone mousse enrobed in a lamina of chocolate. That being said, the genoise was a little too dense for my taste. Tiramisu is supposed to be light, airy and barely there but, it lingers, right? Third was a memoir from my childhood. An ox blood dome with a metallic macaron, (Now you know why I chose this, besides the red of course), was their 'Black Forest Entrement' with a chocolate sponge and vanilla cream offset by dark chocolate mousse and a cherry jelly.

Indoor is spacious enough, but I personally liked the outdoor seating more. Majorly because of the greenary outside. Outdoor seating though limited is super cool wooden chairs and tables giving a rustic jungle setup kind of a vibe.\n\nFood: I ordered peri-peri chicken wings, classic Caesar salad with grilled chicken and peanut butter &amp; chocolate brownie milkshake. Chicken wings were served with sour cream and was super tasty. Hot &amp; spicy just as I like it. Caesar salad was a fiasco, despite taking the order for it twice, they served the wrong version of it i. e-without grilled chicken. On asking for it they readily agreed to exchange only to make me keep waiting and return at the end to say that chicken is not available. It should have been told while placing the order itself, not after pointing it out. That was a big let down. Beverage was tasty but the quantity was on the lower side.\n\nService: Staffs taking the order &amp; serving were courteous. Although I was very disappointed because of the Caesar salad fiasco. I rate the 'service' the highest because that's the only thing that differentiates between a dine-in and a delivery experience. Having said that, this would definitely had impacted their ratings in my record. But then one of their chefs humbly apologized for not being able to serve the desired order. That behavior changes the game for me. I really appreciate that kind of behavior.\n\nSuggestion: Kindly make sure that the menu on the menu-card is sufficiently available at least at the start of the day &amp; due to some reason if it's not available, make sure to tell it to the customer way in advance while he/she is placing the order.\n\nApart from the limited good food that I tasted, I would recommend this place purely because of that chef's behavior.", "reviewTimeFriendly": "one month ago", "userName": "The Gastronomer", "reviewTime": "2018-09-15 15:46:49", "ratingColor": "5BA829", "timestamp": 1537006609, "rating": 4}}, {"review": {"id": 38885176, "rating_5": 5, "reviewText": "Best wings I have ever had.

I had a wait for about 10-15 mts while they baked my pizza. It was a good size and I tried to do justice to it by leaving out only the smallest 2 slices with the smallest slice of pepperoni and bacon.  Pleasing and filling.

The food was delicious. The pastries to die for. Few things however need to be addressed:\n1) service. I see other users have said the wait staff are rude. That's not the impression I got. I think there are too few of them and they are stressed with having too much to do. Lavonne really needs more staff. The guy who took our order was also whipping up the drinks and handling the till. There's too much chaos in floor management. Which is a pity because the product is good and is being let down by poor organization.\n\n2) we sat in the outdoor seating but soon enough rushed indoors because other tables were smoking up a storm. I guess it's management's prerogative how they want to handle the smoking zone in their establishments, but this was really awful. If you're a non smoker and find cigarette smoke gross, sit inside. Also, it would be great if management labelled the area outside as a smoking zone, then customers would know to steer clear. It's one thing to sit in an outdoor terrace at a pub and smoke, but at breakfast, really?\n\n3) Don't keep people waiting for their orders, especially when there are children at the table. I felt really sorry for the family behind us who had to wait for a long time with hungry but well behaved kids. The mother had to finally go make a fuss at the counter before their order was sent to their table.\n\nBut the food, especially the baked goods are awesome.

Close to office and a good time out from work. But I was very disappointed to see that Lavonne has not been able to maintain it's standard. Once I was served an order even before the table I was sitting was cleared. So it had left over food from whoever was sitting before me and the guy who was serving me decided to serve me without even clearing and cleaning the table. When I asked him that he should have cleared the table first he just gave me a look and went off. Another time when it was too crowded and I was occupying one table one of the manager looking guys made it so awkward for me that I had to leave the table as soon as I was done eating. He kept coming out to the open smoking area and would just stand there and observe to make it awkward. So so disappointed.

However my cousin who is a vegetarian had asked for the eggs Benedict without the bacon but it came with the bacon. We asked them to change it , but I think they just picked out the pieces of bacon and gave us the same dish back because she found a few pieces inside. But by then we were all too hangry to care. The choux pastry was great but the bacon bits were a damper. On the whole their service was extremely slow and a little distracted which kinda ruined our experience.

Achieving balance? I'd like to think so. Ok, full disclosure : I went to Lavonne Cafe, Indranagar, Bangalore, just to try their desserts. Desserts, for me, have to have chocolate. Nothing else makes the cut. From left to right : 'Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Tart' was my favourite, with chocolate mousse on top, an almond sponge as the core and caramelised hazelnuts with bitter caramel in between. The middle one's a classic 'Tiramisu' but there wasn't anything &quot;classic&quot; about it. They've turned it into their own rendition of a coffee genoise with a fluffy mascarpone mousse enrobed in a lamina of chocolate. That being said, the genoise was a little too dense for my taste. Tiramisu is supposed to be light, airy and barely there but, it lingers, right? Third was a memoir from my childhood. An ox blood dome with a metallic macaron, (Now you know why I chose this, besides the red of course), was their 'Black Forest Entrement' with a chocolate sponge and vanilla cream offset by dark chocolate mousse and a cherry jelly.

The food was delicious. The pastries to die for. Few things however need to be addressed:\n1) service. I see other users have said the wait staff are rude. That's not the impression I got. I think there are too few of them and they are stressed with having too much to do. Lavonne really needs more staff. The guy who took our order was also whipping up the drinks and handling the till. There's too much chaos in floor management. Which is a pity because the product is good and is being let down by poor organization.\n\n2) we sat in the outdoor seating but soon enough rushed indoors because other tables were smoking up a storm. I guess it's management's prerogative how they want to handle the smoking zone in their establishments, but this was really awful. If you're a non smoker and find cigarette smoke gross, sit inside. Also, it would be great if management labelled the area outside as a smoking zone, then customers would know to steer clear. It's one thing to sit in an outdoor terrace at a pub and smoke, but at breakfast, really?\n\n3) Don't keep people waiting for their orders, especially when there are children at the table. I felt really sorry for the family behind us who had to wait for a long time with hungry but well behaved kids. The mother had to finally go make a fuss at the counter before their order was sent to their table.\n\nBut the food, especially the baked goods are awesome.

Achieving balance? I'd like to think so. Ok, full disclosure : I went to Lavonne Cafe, Indranagar, Bangalore, just to try their desserts. Desserts, for me, have to have chocolate. Nothing else makes the cut. From left to right : 'Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Tart' was my favourite, with chocolate mousse on top, an almond sponge as the core and caramelised hazelnuts with bitter caramel in between. The middle one's a classic 'Tiramisu' but there wasn't anything &quot;classic&quot; about it. They've turned it into their own rendition of a coffee genoise with a fluffy mascarpone mousse enrobed in a lamina of chocolate. That being said, the genoise was a little too dense for my taste. Tiramisu is supposed to be light, airy and barely there but, it lingers, right? Third was a memoir from my childhood. An ox blood dome with a metallic macaron, (Now you know why I chose this, besides the red of course), was their 'Black Forest Entrement' with a chocolate sponge and vanilla cream offset by dark chocolate mousse and a cherry jelly. This was the prettiest out of the three. Their creations were made using quality ingredients and it reflects that. Though I have to point out the tart base that comes with each dessert is hard and makes consumption a struggle. Still, there is emphasis on texture with balanced flavours and that makes up for it.\n.\n.\nFood : 3.5/5 | Ambience : 4/5 | VFM : 4/5 | \nTag somebody who needs chocolate as much as I do in their lives.\n\n#lavonnecafe #indiranagar #nammabengaluru #imsohungry"}}, {"review": {"timestamp": 1536590420, "rating_5": 5, "ratingColor": "305D02", "reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago", "reviewTime": "2018-09-10 20:10:20", "id": 38973050, "userName": "Pratiksha", "rating": 5, "reviewText": "It's a nice cafe...but I go there only for their amazing and unique desserts.. it is one of the best place to have some tasty and gorgeous looking desserts...a must try place \ud83d\ude0a"}}, {"review": {"timestamp": 1536325716, "rating_5": 4, "ratingColor": "5BA829", "reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago", "reviewTime": "2018-09-07 18:38:36", "id": 38905308, "userName": "Sai Pujita Thulluri", "rating": 4, "reviewText": "Very nice place with great desserts and a social, pleasant ambience.

We felt humiliated and insulted.\n\nWhen we go out to eat, we not only go to eat but also to have a nice together. We hardly ate and paid the bill and just left.

At first look the steak was tiny - which I was fine with. In the end it's a diet meal. But no way in hell was it a tenderloin cut. It was just two lumps of meat of just different sizes. There was more Bizzaro - they had given me a side - Rice (looked like jeera rice). Rice in a Keto meal! Almost a punchline in a joke. Not yet, wait for it\n\nI asked them is this intentional?

Indoor is spacious enough, but I personally liked the outdoor seating more. Majorly because of the greenary outside. Outdoor seating though limited is super cool wooden chairs and tables giving a rustic jungle setup kind of a vibe.\n\nFood: I ordered peri-peri chicken wings, classic Caesar salad with grilled chicken and peanut butter &amp; chocolate brownie milkshake. Chicken wings were served with sour cream and was super tasty. Hot &amp; spicy just as I like it. Caesar salad was a fiasco, despite taking the order for it twice, they served the wrong version of it i. e-without grilled chicken. On asking for it they readily agreed to exchange only to make me keep waiting and return at the end to say that chicken is not available. It should have been told while placing the order itself, not after pointing it out. That was a big let down. Beverage was tasty but the quantity was on the lower side.\n\nService: Staffs taking the order &amp; serving were courteous. Although I was very disappointed because of the Caesar salad fiasco. I rate the 'service' the highest because that's the only thing that differentiates between a dine-in and a delivery experience. Having said that, this would definitely had impacted their ratings in my record. But then one of their chefs humbly apologized for not being able to serve the desired order. That behavior changes the game for me. I really appreciate that kind of behavior.\n\nSuggestion: Kindly make sure that the menu on the menu-card is sufficiently available at least at the start of the day &amp; due to some reason if it's not available, make sure to tell it to the customer way in advance while he/she is placing the order.\n\nApart from the limited good food that I tasted, I would recommend this place purely because of that chef's behavior."}}, {"review": {"timestamp": 1536231635, "rating_5": 5, "ratingColor": "305D02", "reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago", "reviewTime": "2018-09-06 16:30:35", "id": 38885176, "userName": "Prateek Malhotra", "rating": 5, "reviewText": "Best wings I have ever had.

Since the afternoon was quite warm, I parked myself inside under a fan. Then it struck me. Django reminded me so much of the coffee shops from my college days (circa 2004) like Beanstalk in Ulsoor, because of the nostalgic vibe I received. The decor&rsquo;s contemporary, and is the kind of place I&rsquo;d expect to find Archie and the gang in, with Jughead wolfing down burgers at the counter stool.

It was spicy and all the ingredients went well together. I expected the Grilled Cheese to be a bit fuller or messier, this one was a light and seemingly healthy version. The peanut butter shake was rich! Service was friendly and fast. \n\nMy only grouse? As I feasted in the above orders, mosquitoes feasted on my already battered legs. Because of the open windows and the tree right outside (and the wet Bangalore weather), mosquitoes were constantly hovering beneath my table, and left me with quite a few bites.

Very bad staff and hopeless food. Burrito and tacos filling was very less. It was just like eating a plain maida chappati. We had to pack the remaining food as we were asked to vacate at 11.05 pm.

The price for a taco, burrito, french fries and unlimited Pepsi was just 240 (veg one), which was very affordable according to me and stomach filling.\n\nThe staff people were helpful and enquired about the kind of taste you would like to have, so that they can give you the best.\n\nA really great place with unique interiors and amazing spicy food.

On asking for it they readily agreed to exchange only to make me keep waiting and return at the end to say that chicken is not available. It should have been told while placing the order itself, not after pointing it out. That was a big let down.

Part Diner, Part Cafe feeling. \n\nI ordered a Roasted Bell Pepper soup, Raw Mango Salad, &agrave; Grilled Cheese and &agrave; Peanut Butter Shake. The soup was good, I really loved the salad! It was spicy and all the ingredients went well together. I expected the Grilled Cheese to be a bit fuller or messier, this one was a light and seemingly healthy version. The peanut butter shake was rich! Service was friendly and fast. \n\nMy only grouse? As I feasted in the above orders, mosquitoes feasted on my already battered legs. Because of the open windows and the tree right outside (and the wet Bangalore weather), mosquitoes were constantly hovering beneath my table, and left me with quite a few bites. Must not wear shorts the next time, and perhaps ask the staff for an electric bat. \n\nGood value, good food and a very good vibe. Will definitely come back again, for a Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup combo! \n\n", "timestamp": 1535541603, "rating_5": 3, "reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago", "reviewTime": "2018-08-29 16:50:03", "ratingColor": "CDD614"}}, {"review": {"userName": "Shantanu Gupta", "rating": 5, "id": 38675646, "reviewText": "Totally loved the food here!

We used to live nearby and knew that the space was quiet and small.\n\nTo their credit, the place looks quite nice and clean. It's got a 90s vibe with the neon signage and the comics. The staff was inexperienced but friendly.\n\nThe menu had a Keto section, which I found interesting, from which I ordered a tenderloin steak and my wife ordered a classic beef steak burger. We also ordered some Jalapeno poppers for starters\n\nHere's where the trouble starts - first they never ask how I want the stake done.This is no fine dining place, it's a cafe - still agreeable\n\nThey took the order and came checking for sides options a few mins later. However, there was no side options for the Keto steak and then they clarifed that they checked by mistake. Okay weird!\n\nNext up the service. Wife got the burger and then the steak came in. At first look the steak was tiny - which I was fine with. In the end it's a diet meal. But no way in hell was it a tenderloin cut. It was just two lumps of meat of just different sizes. There was more Bizzaro - they had given me a side - Rice (looked like jeera rice). Rice in a Keto meal! Almost a punchline in a joke. Not yet, wait for it\n\nI asked them is this intentional? Is this supposed to be Keto friendly? Have I missed a mail? The service personnel went into the kitchen to check and I can hear her ask. A loud reply come from someone in the kitchen - &quot;Complimentary tha ! Nahin Chahiye toh vaapas lelo&quot;\n\nI'm going to leave it at that.\n\nSee, I'm not someone who is fuzzed about the design of cutlery or expects an exquisite dining experience every time I eat out.

The place is pleasantly surrounded by a lot of greenary. Being present in a secluded location, tracking it down is quite a task in itself.\nNow about my experience:\n\nAmbience: The place has got both indoor &amp; outdoor seating. Indoor is spacious enough, but I personally liked the outdoor seating more. Majorly because of the greenary outside. Outdoor seating though limited is super cool wooden chairs and tables giving a rustic jungle setup kind of a vibe.\n\nFood: I ordered peri-peri chicken wings, classic Caesar salad with grilled chicken and peanut butter &amp; chocolate brownie milkshake. Chicken wings were served with sour cream and was super tasty. Hot &amp; spicy just as I like it. Caesar salad was a fiasco, despite taking the order for it twice, they served the wrong version of it i. e-without grilled chicken. On asking for it they readily agreed to exchange only to make me keep waiting and return at the end to say that chicken is not available. It should have been told while placing the order itself, not after pointing it out. That was a big let down. Beverage was tasty but the quantity was on the lower side.\n\nService: Staffs taking the order &amp; serving were courteous. Although I was very disappointed because of the Caesar salad fiasco. I rate the 'service' the highest because that's the only thing that differentiates between a dine-in and a delivery experience. Having said that, this would definitely had impacted their ratings in my record. But then one of their chefs humbly apologized for not being able to serve the desired order. That behavior changes the game for me. I really appreciate that kind of behavior.\n\nSuggestion: Kindly make sure that the menu on the menu-card is sufficiently available at least at the start of the day &amp; due to some reason if it's not available, make sure to tell it to the customer way in advance while he/she is placing the order.\n\nApart from the limited good food that I tasted, I would recommend this place purely because of that chef's behavior.", "userName": "The Gastronomer", "ratingColor": "5BA829", "rating_5": 4, "id": 39057608}}, {"review": {"reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago", "timestamp": 1536231635, "reviewTime": "2018-09-06 16:30:35", "rating": 5, "reviewText": "Best wings I have ever had.

I&rsquo;ve passed by Django a few times, and finally went in recently. \n\nIt&rsquo;s on the first floor of a building, and has the option of a small outdoor seating section. Since the afternoon was quite warm, I parked myself inside under a fan. Then it struck me. Django reminded me so much of the coffee shops from my college days (circa 2004) like Beanstalk in Ulsoor, because of the nostalgic vibe I received. The decor&rsquo;s contemporary, and is the kind of place I&rsquo;d expect to find Archie and the gang in, with Jughead wolfing down burgers at the counter stool. Part Diner, Part Cafe feeling. \n\nI ordered a Roasted Bell Pepper soup, Raw Mango Salad, &agrave; Grilled Cheese and &agrave; Peanut Butter Shake. The soup was good, I really loved the salad! It was spicy and all the ingredients went well together. I expected the Grilled Cheese to be a bit fuller or messier, this one was a light and seemingly healthy version. The peanut butter shake was rich! Service was friendly and fast. \n\nMy only grouse? As I feasted in the above orders, mosquitoes feasted on my already battered legs. Because of the open windows and the tree right outside (and the wet Bangalore weather), mosquitoes were constantly hovering beneath my table, and left me with quite a few bites. Must not wear shorts the next time, and perhaps ask the staff for an electric bat. \n\nGood value, good food and a very good vibe.

The ambiance of the place is cafe like and the music compliments that ambiance too. The food is also very good. The mocktails had a little less sugar but I asked them for some more. The bacon cheese poppers were tasty and a little dry but the door fixed that.\n\nThe wings tasted horrible! The chicken tasted RANCID.\nWhen I told the owner, he said he worked for LEELA AND OBEROI and all chicken is frozen and old! He was ARROGANT. Just for that arrogance and ignorance, I'm giving a 1 star rating.\n\nTheir sauce is good. The pizza was good. The pizza sauce and the toppings we're generously served. The beef burger was also very good and juicy. They have their own home baked deserts. I had the Virgin Mojito Cupcake. Yes you read that right.

I had a wait for about 10-15 mts while they baked my pizza. It was a good size and I tried to do justice to it by leaving out only the smallest 2 slices with the smallest slice of pepperoni and bacon.  Pleasing and filling. There was a retro radio that belted out contemporary numbers, just at the right volume.

It&rsquo;s pocket friendly for sure, especially the South Indian breakfast items. Two people can have a proper meal here for under 500 Rupees, a plus point given the neighborhood!\n\nAmbiance? Not what you&rsquo;d go here for. Unless you enjoy the din and clatter you&rsquo;d find in a Darshini hotel, not to mention the food smells right from the entrance. I&rsquo;m comfortable in such places, and Udupi Park fits the bill well. \n\nFood is not the best, but not bad either. In this part of Indiranagar, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find such a variety, with the convenient location and low prices. I like the idli/vada combo, as well as the ghee rice and daal. Haven&rsquo;t had much else here. \n\nI would have given another star, if there was safe (from towing vehicles) parking in the immediate vicinity. And if the service was a bit faster.

But that&rsquo;s the place for a good hang out; spend some time talking with friends. Went to this place for a quick bite being near to workplace.\n\nYou can choose from tacos, burritos, quesadillas and crunch-wraps; each has vegetarian and non-vegetarian option. The taco tasted good had cheese and enough filling. Coming to the food, we took Naked Chicken Taco and coke , and tacos were totally yummy, crunchy outside and saucy inside. The quantity is pretty good which might fulfil your hunger completely. Nachos are served in different combinations and all are nice and crunchy.\n\nAmbiance is very simple like any other western fast-food joint. Staff was nice.\n\nOverall experience was nice but not to overwhelm about. Do give this place a try if you want simple Mexican tacos.

Charcoal Mushroom: Mushrooms stuffed with cottage cheese in between and grilled.

Mushrooms in Chipotle sauce with green and black olives, cherry tomatoes and jalapenos. Wow! I loved this dish.\n\nCome back to our thali. We were served the main course in a different thali with all different sabzis all around inside the plate in small bowls accompanied with assorted breads( tandoori rooti and butter naan).

It's served in a bucket, legit and just adds to the authenticity of the ambience. The seasoning was slightly on the lower side, but it's okay to an extent because you can always add some salt but not lessen it from a dish! Only that, maybe it would be slightly more appealing with some garnish on it. Maybe some coriander, because our olfactory senses certainly get triggered by the way the food looks.\nNext was, the paneer Delhi style - perfectly balanced spices, freshly cut cubes of cottage cheese, ideally soft and soaked in rich &quot;Dilliwali gravy!&quot; Yum.\nComing to the Hyderabadi Biryani, you expect it to be spicy and I wasn't even in the least disappointed. I'd give a 9/10 to the food.\nThe only reason why I wouldn't give this place a 5 star is the fact that I'd asked for water and a waiter just walked off and served water at the next table despite us asking for it before! I mean, I understand there was a lot of rush as we had to wait for 15minutes to get a table but it was a totally unacceptable behaviour to not serve water when requested.\nAlso, the glasses weren't polished up to the mark.\nIf you're giving us copper plated utensils, might as well just make sure they're worth the show!\nOn another note, it's okay to be asking a guest to write a review but NOT repeatedly ask to do the same when we've already said that we'd post a review.

We used to live nearby and knew that the space was quiet and small.\n\nTo their credit, the place looks quite nice and clean. It's got a 90s vibe with the neon signage and the comics. The staff was inexperienced but friendly.\n\nThe menu had a Keto section, which I found interesting, from which I ordered a tenderloin steak and my wife ordered a classic beef steak burger. We also ordered some Jalapeno poppers for starters\n\nHere's where the trouble starts - first they never ask how I want the stake done.This is no fine dining place, it's a cafe - still agreeable\n\nThey took the order and came checking for sides options a few mins later. However, there was no side options for the Keto steak and then they clarifed that they checked by mistake. Okay weird!\n\nNext up the service. Wife got the burger and then the steak came in. At first look the steak was tiny - which I was fine with. In the end it's a diet meal. But no way in hell was it a tenderloin cut. It was just two lumps of meat of just different sizes. There was more Bizzaro - they had given me a side - Rice (looked like jeera rice). Rice in a Keto meal! Almost a punchline in a joke. Not yet, wait for it\n\nI asked them is this intentional? Is this supposed to be Keto friendly? Have I missed a mail? The service personnel went into the kitchen to check and I can hear her ask. A loud reply come from someone in the kitchen - &quot;Complimentary tha ! Nahin Chahiye toh vaapas lelo&quot;\n\nI'm going to leave it at that.\n\nSee, I'm not someone who is fuzzed about the design of cutlery or expects an exquisite dining experience every time I eat out.

The place is pleasantly surrounded by a lot of greenary. Being present in a secluded location, tracking it down is quite a task in itself.\nNow about my experience:\n\nAmbience: The place has got both indoor &amp; outdoor seating. Indoor is spacious enough, but I personally liked the outdoor seating more. Majorly because of the greenary outside. Outdoor seating though limited is super cool wooden chairs and tables giving a rustic jungle setup kind of a vibe.\n\nFood: I ordered peri-peri chicken wings, classic Caesar salad with grilled chicken and peanut butter &amp; chocolate brownie milkshake. Chicken wings were served with sour cream and was super tasty. Hot &amp; spicy just as I like it. Caesar salad was a fiasco, despite taking the order for it twice, they served the wrong version of it i. e-without grilled chicken. On asking for it they readily agreed to exchange only to make me keep waiting and return at the end to say that chicken is not available. It should have been told while placing the order itself, not after pointing it out. That was a big let down. Beverage was tasty but the quantity was on the lower side.\n\nService: Staffs taking the order &amp; serving were courteous. Although I was very disappointed because of the Caesar salad fiasco. I rate the 'service' the highest because that's the only thing that differentiates between a dine-in and a delivery experience. Having said that, this would definitely had impacted their ratings in my record. But then one of their chefs humbly apologized for not being able to serve the desired order. That behavior changes the game for me. I really appreciate that kind of behavior.\n\nSuggestion: Kindly make sure that the menu on the menu-card is sufficiently available at least at the start of the day &amp; due to some reason if it's not available, make sure to tell it to the customer way in advance while he/she is placing the order.\n\nApart from the limited good food that I tasted, I would recommend this place purely because of that chef's behavior."}}, {"review": {"reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago", "id": 38885176, "rating": 5, "reviewTime": "2018-09-06 16:30:35", "timestamp": 1536231635, "rating_5": 5, "userName": "Prateek Malhotra", "ratingColor": "305D02", "reviewText": "Best wings I have ever had.

I&rsquo;ve passed by Django a few times, and finally went in recently. \n\nIt&rsquo;s on the first floor of a building, and has the option of a small outdoor seating section. Since the afternoon was quite warm, I parked myself inside under a fan. Then it struck me. Django reminded me so much of the coffee shops from my college days (circa 2004) like Beanstalk in Ulsoor, because of the nostalgic vibe I received. The decor&rsquo;s contemporary, and is the kind of place I&rsquo;d expect to find Archie and the gang in, with Jughead wolfing down burgers at the counter stool. Part Diner, Part Cafe feeling. \n\nI ordered a Roasted Bell Pepper soup, Raw Mango Salad, &agrave; Grilled Cheese and &agrave; Peanut Butter Shake. The soup was good, I really loved the salad! It was spicy and all the ingredients went well together. I expected the Grilled Cheese to be a bit fuller or messier, this one was a light and seemingly healthy version. The peanut butter shake was rich! Service was friendly and fast. \n\nMy only grouse? As I feasted in the above orders, mosquitoes feasted on my already battered legs. Because of the open windows and the tree right outside (and the wet Bangalore weather), mosquitoes were constantly hovering beneath my table, and left me with quite a few bites. Must not wear shorts the next time, and perhaps ask the staff for an electric bat. \n\nGood value, good food and a very good vibe. Will definitely come back again, for a Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup combo! \n\n"}}, {"review": {"reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago", "id": 38675646, "rating": 5, "reviewTime": "2018-08-27 12:26:58", "timestamp": 1535353018, "rating_5": 5, "userName": "Shantanu Gupta", "ratingColor": "305D02", "reviewText": "Totally loved the food here!

It's on the first floor and has both outdoor seating and indoor seating.\n\nThe place can house very few people thought. 35 people on the high side. The ambiance of the place is cafe like and the music compliments that ambiance too. The food is also very good. The mocktails had a little less sugar but I asked them for some more. The bacon cheese poppers were tasty and a little dry but the door fixed that.\n\nThe wings tasted horrible! The chicken tasted RANCID.\nWhen I told the owner, he said he worked for LEELA AND OBEROI and all chicken is frozen and old! He was ARROGANT. Just for that arrogance and ignorance, I'm giving a 1 star rating.\n\nTheir sauce is good. The pizza was good. The pizza sauce and the toppings we're generously served. The beef burger was also very good and juicy. They have their own home baked deserts. I had the Virgin Mojito Cupcake. Yes you read that right. It was tasty.\n\nFinally, I had the Mint Chocolate Start which was heavily topped with chocolate and tasted amazing. Overall average food and a cramped place.

I had a wait for about 10-15 mts while they baked my pizza. It was a good size and I tried to do justice to it by leaving out only the smallest 2 slices with the smallest slice of pepperoni and bacon.  Pleasing and filling. There was a retro radio that belted out contemporary numbers, just at the right volume.

I think there are too few of them and they are stressed with having too much to do. Lavonne really needs more staff. The guy who took our order was also whipping up the drinks and handling the till. There's too much chaos in floor management. Which is a pity because the product is good and is being let down by poor organization.\n\n2) we sat in the outdoor seating but soon enough rushed indoors because other tables were smoking up a storm. I guess it's management's prerogative how they want to handle the smoking zone in their establishments, but this was really awful. If you're a non smoker and find cigarette smoke gross, sit inside. Also, it would be great if management labelled the area outside as a smoking zone, then customers would know to steer clear. It's one thing to sit in an outdoor terrace at a pub and smoke, but at breakfast, really?\n\n3) Don't keep people waiting for their orders, especially when there are children at the table. I felt really sorry for the family behind us who had to wait for a long time with hungry but well behaved kids.

(As if)\nI knew only food could make this day better. \nSlightly hungover and definitely grumpy, I made my way to the @lavonneacademyindia caf&eacute;, Indiranagar. With all glass walls and their red doors, the place was well lit and tastefully done. \nThe desserts have been on my list for a while. But their savoury dishes blew my mind. \nFirst off, &ldquo;Br&ucirc;l&eacute;ed figs, roasted beets, arugula, basil tied together with buffalo mozzarella. (\u20b9220+\u20b960 for addition of grilled chicken). A lot of places serve this dish but,\nhere at Lavonne they know what they&rsquo;re doing. The delicate crackle gave way to the sweet, firm yet lush figs with a slight char. \nLoved the textural play and points for the almond slivers! \nNext up, penne with cherry tomatoes, shitake &amp; button mushrooms tossed in a browned b&eacute;chamel.(\u20b9220+\u20b960 for addition of grilled chicken).\nYes, browned - I was quite apprehensive but guysss, we polished off the plate. Creamy and extremely well made. \nThe only negative was that the grilled chicken in both the dishes was tough and chewy. \nI&rsquo;ll cover the desserts in my next post, they deserve their own spotlight. .\n.\n.\n\nFood : 4.5/5 | Ambience : 4/5 | VFM : 4/5 | \n#lavonnecafe #indiranagar #nammabengaluru #chennaifoodblogger #foodreview #foodie #imsohungry #foodismybestfriend #fbci #foodtalkindia #indianfoodstories #chennaifoodguide #wherechennaieats #walkwithindia #sochennai #thingstodoinchennai #foodfreakschennai #foodofchennai #_dtn #chennai_untold #itz_chennai #tftjoyofsharing\n\n\nI'm one of those people who craves for something sweet after every meal. Achieving balance? I'd like to think so. Ok, full disclosure : I went to Lavonne Cafe, Indranagar, Bangalore, just to try their desserts. Desserts, for me, have to have chocolate. Nothing else makes the cut. From left to right : 'Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Tart' was my favourite, with chocolate mousse on top, an almond sponge as the core and caramelised hazelnuts with bitter caramel in between. The middle one's a classic 'Tiramisu' but there wasn't anything &quot;classic&quot; about it. They've turned it into their own rendition of a coffee genoise with a fluffy mascarpone mousse enrobed in a lamina of chocolate. That being said, the genoise was a little too dense for my taste. Tiramisu is supposed to be light, airy and barely there but, it lingers, right? Third was a memoir from my childhood. An ox blood dome with a metallic macaron, (Now you know why I chose this, besides the red of course), was their 'Black Forest Entrement' with a chocolate sponge and vanilla cream offset by dark chocolate mousse and a cherry jelly. This was the prettiest out of the three. Their creations were made using quality ingredients and it reflects that. Though I have to point out the tart base that comes with each dessert is hard and makes consumption a struggle. Still, there is emphasis on texture with balanced flavours and that makes up for it.\n.\n.\nFood : 3.5/5 | Ambience : 4/5 | VFM : 4/5 | \nTag somebody who needs chocolate as much as I do in their lives.\n\n#lavonnecafe #indiranagar #nammabengaluru #imsohungry", "userName": "Sethu Kumar", "reviewTimeFriendly": "one month ago"}}, {"review": {"rating_5": 5, "timestamp": 1536590420, "rating": 5, "ratingColor": "305D02", "id": 38973050, "reviewTime": "2018-09-10 20:10:20", "reviewText": "It's a nice cafe...but I go there only for their amazing and unique desserts.. it is one of the best place to have some tasty and gorgeous looking desserts...a must try place \ud83d\ude0a", "userName": "Pratiksha", "reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago"}}, {"review": {"rating_5": 4, "timestamp": 1536325716, "rating": 4, "ratingColor": "5BA829", "id": 38905308, "reviewTime": "2018-09-07 18:38:36", "reviewText": "Very nice place with great desserts and a social, pleasant ambience.

The place is pleasantly surrounded by a lot of greenary. Being present in a secluded location, tracking it down is quite a task in itself.\nNow about my experience:\n\nAmbience: The place has got both indoor &amp; outdoor seating. Indoor is spacious enough, but I personally liked the outdoor seating more. Majorly because of the greenary outside. Outdoor seating though limited is super cool wooden chairs and tables giving a rustic jungle setup kind of a vibe.\n\nFood: I ordered peri-peri chicken wings, classic Caesar salad with grilled chicken and peanut butter &amp; chocolate brownie milkshake. Chicken wings were served with sour cream and was super tasty. Hot &amp; spicy just as I like it. Caesar salad was a fiasco, despite taking the order for it twice, they served the wrong version of it i. e-without grilled chicken. On asking for it they readily agreed to exchange only to make me keep waiting and return at the end to say that chicken is not available. It should have been told while placing the order itself, not after pointing it out. That was a big let down. Beverage was tasty but the quantity was on the lower side.\n\nService: Staffs taking the order &amp; serving were courteous. Although I was very disappointed because of the Caesar salad fiasco. I rate the 'service' the highest because that's the only thing that differentiates between a dine-in and a delivery experience. Having said that, this would definitely had impacted their ratings in my record. But then one of their chefs humbly apologized for not being able to serve the desired order. That behavior changes the game for me. I really appreciate that kind of behavior.\n\nSuggestion: Kindly make sure that the menu on the menu-card is sufficiently available at least at the start of the day &amp; due to some reason if it's not available, make sure to tell it to the customer way in advance while he/she is placing the order.\n\nApart from the limited good food that I tasted, I would recommend this place purely because of that chef's behavior.", "userName": "The Gastronomer", "reviewTimeFriendly": "one month ago"}}, {"review": {"rating_5": 5, "timestamp": 1536231635, "rating": 5, "ratingColor": "305D02", "id": 38885176, "reviewTime": "2018-09-06 16:30:35", "reviewText": "Best wings I have ever had.

I&rsquo;ve passed by Django a few times, and finally went in recently. \n\nIt&rsquo;s on the first floor of a building, and has the option of a small outdoor seating section. Since the afternoon was quite warm, I parked myself inside under a fan. Then it struck me. Django reminded me so much of the coffee shops from my college days (circa 2004) like Beanstalk in Ulsoor, because of the nostalgic vibe I received. The decor&rsquo;s contemporary, and is the kind of place I&rsquo;d expect to find Archie and the gang in, with Jughead wolfing down burgers at the counter stool. Part Diner, Part Cafe feeling. \n\nI ordered a Roasted Bell Pepper soup, Raw Mango Salad, &agrave; Grilled Cheese and &agrave; Peanut Butter Shake. The soup was good, I really loved the salad! It was spicy and all the ingredients went well together. I expected the Grilled Cheese to be a bit fuller or messier, this one was a light and seemingly healthy version. The peanut butter shake was rich! Service was friendly and fast. \n\nMy only grouse? As I feasted in the above orders, mosquitoes feasted on my already battered legs. Because of the open windows and the tree right outside (and the wet Bangalore weather), mosquitoes were constantly hovering beneath my table, and left me with quite a few bites. Must not wear shorts the next time, and perhaps ask the staff for an electric bat. \n\nGood value, good food and a very good vibe. Will definitely come back again, for a Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup combo! \n\n", "userName": "JayR", "reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago"}}, {"review": {"rating_5": 5, "timestamp": 1535353018, "rating": 5, "ratingColor": "305D02", "id": 38675646, "reviewTime": "2018-08-27 12:26:58", "reviewText": "Totally loved the food here!

We used to live nearby and knew that the space was quiet and small.\n\nTo their credit, the place looks quite nice and clean. It's got a 90s vibe with the neon signage and the comics. The staff was inexperienced but friendly.\n\nThe menu had a Keto section, which I found interesting, from which I ordered a tenderloin steak and my wife ordered a classic beef steak burger. We also ordered some Jalapeno poppers for starters\n\nHere's where the trouble starts - first they never ask how I want the stake done.This is no fine dining place, it's a cafe - still agreeable\n\nThey took the order and came checking for sides options a few mins later. However, there was no side options for the Keto steak and then they clarifed that they checked by mistake. Okay weird!\n\nNext up the service. Wife got the burger and then the steak came in. At first look the steak was tiny - which I was fine with. In the end it's a diet meal. But no way in hell was it a tenderloin cut. It was just two lumps of meat of just different sizes. There was more Bizzaro - they had given me a side - Rice (looked like jeera rice). Rice in a Keto meal! Almost a punchline in a joke. Not yet, wait for it\n\nI asked them is this intentional? Is this supposed to be Keto friendly? Have I missed a mail? The service personnel went into the kitchen to check and I can hear her ask. A loud reply come from someone in the kitchen - &quot;Complimentary tha !

The place is pleasantly surrounded by a lot of greenary. Being present in a secluded location, tracking it down is quite a task in itself.\nNow about my experience:\n\nAmbience: The place has got both indoor &amp; outdoor seating. Indoor is spacious enough, but I personally liked the outdoor seating more. Majorly because of the greenary outside. Outdoor seating though limited is super cool wooden chairs and tables giving a rustic jungle setup kind of a vibe.\n\nFood: I ordered peri-peri chicken wings, classic Caesar salad with grilled chicken and peanut butter &amp; chocolate brownie milkshake. Chicken wings were served with sour cream and was super tasty. Hot &amp; spicy just as I like it. Caesar salad was a fiasco, despite taking the order for it twice, they served the wrong version of it i. e-without grilled chicken. On asking for it they readily agreed to exchange only to make me keep waiting and return at the end to say that chicken is not available. It should have been told while placing the order itself, not after pointing it out. That was a big let down. Beverage was tasty but the quantity was on the lower side.\n\nService: Staffs taking the order &amp; serving were courteous. Although I was very disappointed because of the Caesar salad fiasco. I rate the 'service' the highest because that's the only thing that differentiates between a dine-in and a delivery experience. Having said that, this would definitely had impacted their ratings in my record. But then one of their chefs humbly apologized for not being able to serve the desired order. That behavior changes the game for me. I really appreciate that kind of behavior.\n\nSuggestion: Kindly make sure that the menu on the menu-card is sufficiently available at least at the start of the day &amp; due to some reason if it's not available, make sure to tell it to the customer way in advance while he/she is placing the order.\n\nApart from the limited good food that I tasted, I would recommend this place purely because of that chef's behavior.", "rating": 4, "timestamp": 1537006609, "reviewTime": "2018-09-15 15:46:49", "reviewTimeFriendly": "one month ago", "userName": "The Gastronomer"}}, {"review": {"ratingColor": "305D02", "rating_5": 5, "id": 38885176, "reviewText": "Best wings I have ever had.

Since the afternoon was quite warm, I parked myself inside under a fan. Then it struck me. Django reminded me so much of the coffee shops from my college days (circa 2004) like Beanstalk in Ulsoor, because of the nostalgic vibe I received. The decor&rsquo;s contemporary, and is the kind of place I&rsquo;d expect to find Archie and the gang in, with Jughead wolfing down burgers at the counter stool.

It was spicy and all the ingredients went well together. I expected the Grilled Cheese to be a bit fuller or messier, this one was a light and seemingly healthy version. The peanut butter shake was rich! Service was friendly and fast. \n\nMy only grouse? As I feasted in the above orders, mosquitoes feasted on my already battered legs. Because of the open windows and the tree right outside (and the wet Bangalore weather), mosquitoes were constantly hovering beneath my table, and left me with quite a few bites. Must not wear shorts the next time, and perhaps ask the staff for an electric bat. \n\nGood value, good food and a very good vibe.

I had a wait for about 10-15 mts while they baked my pizza. It was a good size and I tried to do justice to it by leaving out only the smallest 2 slices with the smallest slice of pepperoni and bacon.  Pleasing and filling. There was a retro radio that belted out contemporary numbers, just at the right volume.

I think there are too few of them and they are stressed with having too much to do. Lavonne really needs more staff. The guy who took our order was also whipping up the drinks and handling the till. There's too much chaos in floor management. Which is a pity because the product is good and is being let down by poor organization.\n\n2) we sat in the outdoor seating but soon enough rushed indoors because other tables were smoking up a storm. I guess it's management's prerogative how they want to handle the smoking zone in their establishments, but this was really awful. If you're a non smoker and find cigarette smoke gross, sit inside. Also, it would be great if management labelled the area outside as a smoking zone, then customers would know to steer clear. It's one thing to sit in an outdoor terrace at a pub and smoke, but at breakfast, really?\n\n3) Don't keep people waiting for their orders, especially when there are children at the table. I felt really sorry for the family behind us who had to wait for a long time with hungry but well behaved kids.

Achieving balance? I'd like to think so. Ok, full disclosure : I went to Lavonne Cafe, Indranagar, Bangalore, just to try their desserts. Desserts, for me, have to have chocolate. Nothing else makes the cut. From left to right : 'Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Tart' was my favourite, with chocolate mousse on top, an almond sponge as the core and caramelised hazelnuts with bitter caramel in between. The middle one's a classic 'Tiramisu' but there wasn't anything &quot;classic&quot; about it. They've turned it into their own rendition of a coffee genoise with a fluffy mascarpone mousse enrobed in a lamina of chocolate. That being said, the genoise was a little too dense for my taste. Tiramisu is supposed to be light, airy and barely there but, it lingers, right? Third was a memoir from my childhood. An ox blood dome with a metallic macaron, (Now you know why I chose this, besides the red of course), was their 'Black Forest Entrement' with a chocolate sponge and vanilla cream offset by dark chocolate mousse and a cherry jelly. This was the prettiest out of the three. Their creations were made using quality ingredients and it reflects that. Though I have to point out the tart base that comes with each dessert is hard and makes consumption a struggle. Still, there is emphasis on texture with balanced flavours and that makes up for it.\n.\n.\nFood : 3.5/5 | Ambience : 4/5 | VFM : 4/5 | \nTag somebody who needs chocolate as much as I do in their lives.\n\n#lavonnecafe #indiranagar #nammabengaluru #imsohungry", "userName": "Sethu Kumar", "rating_5": 4, "timestamp": 1536648025, "id": 38982391, "ratingColor": "5BA829", "rating": 4, "reviewTimeFriendly": "one month ago", "reviewTime": "2018-09-11 12:10:25"}}, {"review": {"reviewText": "It's a nice cafe...but I go there only for their amazing and unique desserts.. it is one of the best place to have some tasty and gorgeous looking desserts...a must try place \ud83d\ude0a", "userName": "Pratiksha", "rating_5": 5, "timestamp": 1536590420, "id": 38973050, "ratingColor": "305D02", "rating": 5, "reviewTimeFriendly": "2 months ago", "reviewTime": "2018-09-10 20:10:20"}}, {"review": {"reviewText": "Very nice place with great desserts and a social, pleasant ambience.

At first look the steak was tiny - which I was fine with. In the end it's a diet meal. But no way in hell was it a tenderloin cut. It was just two lumps of meat of just different sizes. There was more Bizzaro - they had given me a side - Rice (looked like jeera rice). Rice in a Keto meal! Almost a punchline in a joke. Not yet, wait for it\n\nI asked them is this intentional? Is this supposed to be Keto friendly? Have I missed a mail? The service personnel went into the kitchen to check and I can hear her ask. A loud reply come from someone in the kitchen - &quot;Complimentary tha ! Nahin Chahiye toh vaapas lelo&quot;\n\nI'm going to leave it at that.\n\nSee, I'm not someone who is fuzzed about the design of cutlery or expects an exquisite dining experience every time I eat out. But when a place fails at very low expectations, best thing to do is to pay, leave and not go back again.\n\nPeace\n\n", "userName": "Mohammed Sameer", "rating_5": 2, "timestamp": 1539753723, "id": 39647793, "ratingColor": "FF7800", "rating": 2, "reviewTimeFriendly": "24 days ago", "reviewTime": "2018-10-17 10:52:03"}}, {"review": {"reviewText": "They give mosambi juice instead of orange and they give chicken lollipop instead of chicken wings while delivering the order 1 hour late....", "userName": "Saurabh Lakra", "rating_5": 2, "timestamp": 1538902264, "id": 39492673, "ratingColor": "FF7800", "rating": 2, "reviewTimeFriendly": "one month ago", "reviewTime": "2018-10-07 14:21:04"}}, {"review": {"reviewText": "Great ambience and courteous staff.

The place is pleasantly surrounded by a lot of greenary. Being present in a secluded location, tracking it down is quite a task in itself.\nNow about my experience:\n\nAmbience: The place has got both indoor &amp; outdoor seating. Indoor is spacious enough, but I personally liked the outdoor seating more. Majorly because of the greenary outside. Outdoor seating though limited is super cool wooden chairs and tables giving a rustic jungle setup kind of a vibe.\n\nFood: I ordered peri-peri chicken wings, classic Caesar salad with grilled chicken and peanut butter &amp; chocolate brownie milkshake. Chicken wings were served with sour cream and was super tasty. Hot &amp; spicy just as I like it. Caesar salad was a fiasco, despite taking the order for it twice, they served the wrong version of it i. e-without grilled chicken. On asking for it they readily agreed to exchange only to make me keep waiting and return at the end to say that chicken is not available. It should have been told while placing the order itself, not after pointing it out. That was a big let down. Beverage was tasty but the quantity was on the lower side.\n\nService: Staffs taking the order &amp; serving were courteous. Although I was very disappointed because of the Caesar salad fiasco. I rate the 'service' the highest because that's the only thing that differentiates between a dine-in and a delivery experience. Having said that, this would definitely had impacted their ratings in my record. But then one of their chefs humbly apologized for not being able to serve the desired order. That behavior changes the game for me. I really appreciate that kind of behavior.\n\nSuggestion: Kindly make sure that the menu on the menu-card is sufficiently available at least at the start of the day &amp; due to some reason if it's not available, make sure to tell it to the customer way in advance while he/she is placing the order.\n\nApart from the limited good food that I tasted, I would recommend this place purely because of that chef's behavior.", "userName": "The Gastronomer", "rating_5": 4, "timestamp": 1537006609, "id": 39057608, "ratingColor": "5BA829", "rating": 4, "reviewTimeFriendly": "one month ago", "reviewTime": "2018-09-15 15:46:49"}}, {"review": {"reviewText": "Best wings I have ever had.

Since the afternoon was quite warm, I parked myself inside under a fan. Then it struck me. Django reminded me so much of the coffee shops from my college days (circa 2004) like Beanstalk in Ulsoor, because of the nostalgic vibe I received. The decor&rsquo;s contemporary, and is the kind of place I&rsquo;d expect to find Archie and the gang in, with Jughead wolfing down burgers at the counter stool. Part Diner, Part Cafe feeling. \n\nI ordered a Roasted Bell Pepper soup, Raw Mango Salad, &agrave; Grilled Cheese and &agrave; Peanut Butter Shake. The soup was good, I really loved the salad! It was spicy and all the ingredients went well together. I expected the Grilled Cheese to be a bit fuller or messier, this one was a light and seemingly healthy version. The peanut butter shake was rich! Service was friendly and fast. \n\nMy only grouse? As I feasted in the above orders, mosquitoes feasted on my already battered legs. Because of the open windows and the tree right outside (and the wet Bangalore weather), mosquitoes were constantly hovering beneath my table, and left me with quite a few bites. Must not wear shorts the next time, and perhaps ask the staff for an electric bat. \n\nGood value, good food and a very good vibe.

The ambiance of the place is cafe like and the music compliments that ambiance too. The food is also very good. The mocktails had a little less sugar but I asked them for some more. The bacon cheese poppers were tasty and a little dry but the door fixed that.\n\nThe wings tasted horrible! The chicken tasted RANCID.\nWhen I told the owner, he said he worked for LEELA AND OBEROI and all chicken is frozen and old! He was ARROGANT. Just for that arrogance and ignorance, I'm giving a 1 star rating.\n\nTheir sauce is good. The pizza was good. The pizza sauce and the toppings we're generously served. The beef burger was also very good and juicy. They have their own home baked deserts. I had the Virgin Mojito Cupcake. Yes you read that right. It was tasty.\n\nFinally, I had the Mint Chocolate Start which was heavily topped with chocolate and tasted amazing. Overall average food and a cramped place.
